      I'm a fourteen-year-old Highschool Student at International School of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. I'm passionate about serving God, sports, math, music, dreaming and <b>change</b>. Dreaming of a better Honduras I've decided that it is time you use my talents to start looking for the solution of the Education Lack in the World; starting with my community. I've had the opportunity to have a close friendship with young people near my age with poor education and there is a notary difference between them and my person which led me to strongly believe that education <b><em><u>is a RIGHT and everybody without distinction should have the opportunity to study equally.</u></em></b> In addition, with solving education I think that it would leave a great impact in the world because people will have a better chance of getting a good work and then they will be able to have a stable economy with their families. Thanks to that, poverty could decrease drastically, there will be an increase in people with economic growth and a decent job, and a responsible consumption and production of resources; helping to solve 4 out of 17 of the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations.

   <center><p class="SDG"> This are the United Nations "Sustainable Development Goals" that were established in September 2015 and are set to be achieved for the year 2030. All countries of the world have agreed to work towards achieving these goals but, we can help them do it faster by being nice, kind, compassionate for others and have empathy towards them. Let's be of inspiration and help to others and erradicate those society flaws affecting us all!</p></center>
