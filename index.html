  <h2><u>Identifying the problem</u></h2>
    <br>

  <h3>How is education defined in simple words?</h3>
    <br>
<p> Education is a <i><b>BIG</b></i> factor when talking about society problems. Education is defined as the transmission of knowledge to a person so that he or she acquires a specific training, it enriches the culture, the spirit, the values and everything that characterizes us as human beings.Society now needs people that are experts in what they are “specialized” in. Now-a-days If you want to get a Job of any kind, having previous experience and having a variety of knowledge is pretty much appreciated and very much searching for a Job application </p>

  <p>Education is one of the <b>core rights</b> a kid has when born. Kids from ages 5-15 are already working and fighting for their lives. It is <u>ILLEGAL</u> that a person <u>younger than 17 years of age</u> is already working since it is a requirement that if you want to work you have to <em>have education to at least 6th - 9th grade of knowledge</em> and get passed the National Anthem Exam. The parents of these children who are working are breaking the law since it requires that your child has a good education and these kids are the future of this country. </p> <br> <br>

 <h3 class="h3s">Average School Payments in Honduras</h3>
    <br>
  <strong>
  <p> Public spending on education in Honduras was 133.8 million in 2020, that is, 15.44%, up to 1,101.1 million euros1,232.6 million dollars, which represented 20.12% of public spending total. A 78% of the youth in Honduras hasn’t studied at all and they are losing opportunities of a better life quality and to study something that would be a benefit to society but that is just part of the reality.

  <h3>How does this problem Affect me?</h3>
    <br>
<p>My occupation is to be a student but outside of it I’m a teacher at my church to teenagers like me. I teach the bible and the core values it calls us to have as Christians and I teach kids to play piano. Most of my students between the ages <em>13-16</em> years old but they still <b>CAN'T read fluidly.</b>I like them to read with me and play games but with them it is kind of hard and it has come to my attention that they are the future of the country. I don’t really get along with people from my school or my same social status form my neighborhood but I get along with teens in church which are completely different from me but still treat them the same way and never talk about what I have. I know their dreams and have heard their problems and seen them at firsthand.Knowing all their problems I’m moved to make a change and this is how I can start.</p> <br> <br>
</div>
  <div class="solution">
<h2><u>Working 4 a Solution</u></h2>
    <br>
<p>CDI classes is a program for kids that are at extreme social risk taken from people that attend my church constantly. Kids are taken from the youngest age possible and shown how to read and write in some cases. What I learn I would like to teach little by little to others but since I’m still a minor is that in the classes I give ask them to come a bit sooner and strengthen their reading, writing and comprehension skills because if they know the basics they are able to learn smoothly and even help other through what they learn. I can help inspire others through my example and showing them a bit of what reality actually is. Some people are also thinking how to help others but still need a little push to actually get the total motivation they need to start and make a change. It is time that not only 1 person starts to stand up to a problem but all of us start and work hard to take this problem as an opportunity of change.</p> <br> <br>

<h3>Child care and Dog walking Jobs:</h3> <p>As young people there are not many Job positions we can have but walking dogs in our neighborhood and taking care of kids as their “nanny” and getting a payment for it then it can be donated to the Services to work as part of the Learning Inspire Squad. </p>

    <center>
      <div class="Asso">
    <h3>Association with Education scholarship programs:</h3> <p>Being in association with Scholarship programs when people Donate money we could enroll a kid, a teenager or a college student into a school or college for them to learn or develop their talents (to learn more click here —-> <u><a class="more"href="other.html">MORE PROGRAMS</a></u>)</p>
